I do not actively maintain this project any longer. If you're serious about making a better tool for the r/bodyweightfitness community, I would consider forking this repo or starting a new project from scratch.

If you'd like to submit merge requests though, that's cool too. I'll try my best to review them as quickly as possible but no guarantees.
