# RR Coach

[Live website](https://rr.coach)

A website to guide users through reddit's r/bodyweightfitness [Recommended Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine), commonly referred to as the "RR".

## Getting started

Welcome to the repo, if you would like to contribute (everyone is welcome), please see the [guidelines](https://gitlab.com/spongechameleon/rr-coach/-/blob/CONTRIBUTING.md).

When you're ready to start working, please see the READMEs for both the [frontend](https://gitlab.com/spongechameleon/rr-coach/-/tree/master/frontend) and [backend](https://gitlab.com/spongechameleon/rr-coach/-/tree/master/backend) for startup instructions!

## Design documentation

Please see these [diagrams](https://trello.com/c/hXSQsNcG/5-master-flowchart) (hosted on Trello). Start with "Infrastructure" for the big picture!

FYI: We are going with a JAMStack-like approach here, so the frontend and backend are completely de-coupled and start up separately (only JSON is exchanged between them).
