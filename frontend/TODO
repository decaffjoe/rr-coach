INFRA:
* Style the views
* Pre-load & cache iframes?
* Write docs for the frontend logic

BUGS:
* If workout_id exists but sessionStorage is empty, ask user to repopulate sessionStorage with that workout_id or start a new workout?
    - (If user was in progress of workout but closed & re-opened tab, before workout_id cookie expired)

TEST:
* Like everything haha (write some unit/integration/etc... tests too)
* Persistent workout state tracking
* Training Summary post to db (if not logged in)

FEATURES:
* Training Summary Page:
    - Reverse the default sort of workouts by date (we want most recent at top, oldest at bottom)
    - Comparison tool between any two workouts
        - Latest session is standard by default (but is changeable)
        - Present graph of reps over time
* Rest timer in between each set (too soon <= 90-270s => too long)
* Add alternate paths for strength exercises
    - <select> menu dropdown that changes to an alternate progressions object
