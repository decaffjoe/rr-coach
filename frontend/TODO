INFRA:
* Component-ize the views
* Style the views
* Error handling for all user inputs
* Pre-load & cache iframes?

BUGS:
* Going back to previous sets, reps should be displayed
    - If value of previous set is changed, update should be made to DB/sessionStorage
* Shouldn't be able to add more than 3 sets/exercise to DB/sessionStorage
* Need info for Warmups -> Support Hold | Easier Squat Progression | Easier Hinge Progression

TEST:
* Like everything, actually (write some unit/integration/etc... tests too)
* Persistent workout state tracking
* Training Summary post to db (if not logged in)

FEATURES:
* Training Summary Page:
    - Sort workouts by date
    - Select today's workout by default
    - Change the titles to reflect date chosen
    - Comparison tool between any two workouts
        - Latest session is one by default (but is changeable)
* Remember user exercise variants
    - Store exercise variant values in DB (sessionStorage in-browser)
    - When logging in load variant values from DB
* Rest timer in between each set (too soon <= 90-270s => too long)
