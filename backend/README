Getting started quickly:

[1] git clone git@gitlab.com:spongechameleon/recommended-routine.git
[2] cd recommended-routine/backend

[3] In server.js, change "connectDB()" to "resetDB()" (the lines under "DATABASE TESTING")
[4] In models/dbconfig.js, comment out the postgres connection and uncomment the sqlite connection (the "new Sequelize" lines)

[5] node server.js
